# Let Me Leave, Bro

Do you hate "Are you ***sure*** you want to leave this page?" dialogs that pop up when you try to close a tab? So do I. This is a Chrome extension and Tampermonkey script that prevents execution of those Javascript dialogs that prevent you from leaving a page.

Made out of spite after clicking the "Yes, I'm really sure that I wanted to leave this page, I wouldn't have clicked the fucking X if I didn't" button for the millionth time when attempting to close a tab on a certain unnamed regex-checking website.
